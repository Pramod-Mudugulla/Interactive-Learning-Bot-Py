# InteractiveLearningBot-Py

## Overview
**InteractiveLearningBot-Py** is a simple chatbot application built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. This chatbot is designed to interact with users by responding to their queries based on a predefined knowledge base. If the chatbot does not know the answer to a question, it prompts the user to teach it a new response, allowing the chatbot to learn and improve over time.

## Features
- **User Interaction**: Users can type messages to the chatbot, which responds in real-time.
- **Knowledge Base**: Utilizes a JSON file to store questions and answers, making it easy to update and expand.
- **Learning Capability**: Prompts users to provide answers when the bot doesnâ€™t know a response.
- **Responsive Design**: Clean and minimalistic user interface.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript/jQuery**: For handling user interactions and asynchronous requests.
- **JSON**: For storing the knowledge base.

## Getting Started
