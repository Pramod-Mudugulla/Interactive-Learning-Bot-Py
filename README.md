# InteractiveLearningBot-Py
 Overview InteractiveLearningBot-Py is a simple chatbot application built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. This chatbot is designed to interact with users by responding to their queries based on a predefined knowledge base. If the chatbot does not know the answer to a question, it prompts the user to teach it a new response, allowing the chatbot to learn and improve over time. Features User Interaction: Users can type messages to the chatbot, which responds in real-time. Knowledge Base: The chatbot utilizes a JSON file to store questions and answers, making it easy to update and expand its knowledge. Learning Capability: When the chatbot cannot answer a question, it prompts the user to provide an answer, which is then saved to the knowledge base. Responsive Design: The user interface is designed to be clean and minimalistic, providing an engaging user experience. Technologies Used Flask: A micro web framework for Python used to create the web application. HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the user interface. JavaScript/jQuery: For handling user interactions and making asynchronous requests to the server. JSON: For storing the knowledge base, which contains questions and answers. Getting Started Prerequisites Python 3.x Flask jQuery Installation Clone the repository: bash git clone https://github.com/yourusername/InteractiveLearningBot-Py.git cd InteractiveLearningBot-Py  Install the required packages: bash pip install Flask  Create a knowledge_base.json file in the root directory with the following structure: json {   "questions": [     {       "question": "What is your name?",       "answer": "I am a chatbot."     },     {       "question": "How can you help me?",       "answer": "I can answer your questions."     }   ] }  Run the Flask application: bash python app.py  Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Usage Type your question in the input box and click "Send" or press Enter to submit. If the chatbot does not know the answer, it will ask you to teach it a new response. You can provide a new answer, which will be saved to the knowledge base for future interactions. Contributing Contributions are welcome!
